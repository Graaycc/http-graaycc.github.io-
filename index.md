I am a computer science major with a focus in cybsercurty at CSUF and I plan to graduate in 2029!

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

lab 1

Lab 1, This was the first introduction to coding and programming software I ever encountered, and it opened new doors for me. I appreciated how this Lab showed me the foundation of coding, such as cloning a repository, making edits to code, and pushing it onto GitHub. I also learned to efficiently work with my partner, whom I had just met. Together, we were able to successfully create a team and edit the AUTHORS.md file and also commit our changes with meaningful messages. 

lab 02

Lab 2, I enjoyed how Lab 2 was a continuation from the first lab and continued to build off of the foundation while also teaching basics. During this lab, I learned how to create a well-written program using strings to prompt users for input. Although it was challenging to ensure that the format was correct and compile it, it was rewarding when the code worked and was able to be pushed to GitHub. 

lab 09

Lab 9, part-1 is my top favorite lab, as I have learned more about coding throughout previous labs and now have experience in writing and debugging programs. Using vectors in the lab was interesting as I had learned about it through readings and I was finally able to use a list to scan documents and search for needed materials and information
